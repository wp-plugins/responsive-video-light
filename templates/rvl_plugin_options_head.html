                <p>
                    Welcome to Responsive Video Light, the simplest way to embed a
                    video from YouTube or Vimeo that responds to various browser sizes
                    anywhere shortcodes are supported on your WordPress website.

                <p>
                    This settings page allows you to set up site-wide defaults for the
                    various options you can use to control how your videos behave and/or
                    look.  Any of the options here can be easily overridden on the fly
                    by using a corresponding shortcode parameter in your shortcode.  It's
                    probably best to show you how simple this is by using an example.

                    Let's say you were embedding a YouTube video into a blog post, and 
                    that video resides at 
                    <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soagYwfgfxc</code>. The basic
                    shortcode for that video would be 
                    <code>[responsive_youtube soagYwfgfxc]</code>. Now let's say you had
                    chosen to, by default, allow YouTube's related videos to be shown
                    at the end of each video, but wanted to override that behavior and
                    prohibit that behavior for this particular video.  Your new short
                    tag syntax would look like this: 
                    <code>[responsive_youtube soagYwfgfxc norel]</code>.  Easy peasy.
                </p>

                    Shortcodes, including these, can be used in virtaully any text box,
                    including the post or page editors, or the text widget for 
                    sidebar use.
                <p>
                    With that brief introduction out of the way, lets explain what 
                    options are available to be set for our video services.
