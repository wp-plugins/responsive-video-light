This will display a responsive YouTube or Vimeo video in pages / posts - anywhere shortcodes can be used. 

== Description ==

Features Include:
*The ability to add one or more videos directly in to a page, post or any of your own custom post types using the video URL (not the embed code) or ID and a short code.
*Fully responsive so the video's viewport will fill the width of the containing area and scale depending on screen size. No need to set a width and height, just set the width of the div your content sits in.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 3.0 + 

== Installation ==

1. Download responsive-video-light.zip.
2. Upload responsive-video-light.zip to the plugins/ directory.
3. Enable Responsive Video Light in the Plugin admin panel.
4. Go to Settings > Responsive Video Light and Review the single setting and learn how to embed the videos in your posts or pages.
5. Create a new or edit a post (or page), and insert the shortcode according to the simple syntax.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Says wrong video id or no video shows =

Make sure you have copied the main URL from your address bar for the video and not the supplied embed code.

Make sure you have selected the correct video type. If Vimeo is selected but a YouTube URL is pasted (or vice versa), it will not work.

If this is a Vimeo video, ensure you have permission for the video to be embedded. You may have to contact the video owner to get this.

= Video is not resizing =

Make sure that the <div> that contains the video has a width set and that it is a percentage and not a fixed width.
